Infrastructure As Code - IaC
Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files CODE.
Infrastructure as Code (or IaC) is an automated type of infrastructure management. The model approaches networks, virtual machines, storage etc in a descriptive manner via versioning (similar to DevOps tracking source code).
Like Developers write Application Code to build Applications, Technologies - Java, Python, Node etc
As a DevOps Engineer will be writing Infrastructure Code to build Infrastructure - AWS Cloudformation, Azure ARM, Terraform etc
IaC boosts productivity through automation
Consistency in Setup & Configuration by Minimising risk of human errors
Replicate your infrastructure easily, CODE = REUSABILITY
Makes your infrastructure Auditable, Since you can version control IaC configuration files like any source code file, you have full traceability of the changes
Terraform
Terraform is an Infrastructure As Code IaC software from HashiCorp.
Terraform can build the infrastructure on cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform etc
Infrastructure is defined in HCL - Hashicorp Configuration Language
Setup Terraform
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
Terraform Providers
Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with remote systems(aws/azure/etc).
Every resource type is implemented by a provider, without providers, Terraform can't manage any kind of infrastructure.
AWS - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs
Azure - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.
AWS - IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.
You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorised (has permissions) to use resources.
